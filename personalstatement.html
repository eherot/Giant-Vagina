<blockquote>
  	<p class="style4" style="margin-top: 10px;">
	  	Where to begin? Well, for starters: my name is Syd and I'm a 
		painter, living and working in Somerville, MA. I suppose I 
		should also include the obligatory list of some galleries in 
		which I've shown my work: The Artist's Foundation in South Boston, 
		Bromfield Gallery and Rhys Gallery, both in the South End, and 
		The Rider Project in New York City. I am a recent recipient of a 
		Somerville Arts Council Visual Artist Fellowship, an award that is 
		helping to fund my projects for the next year. In the past, my work 
		was reviewed by The Boston Globe, The Providence Phoenix and, most 
		notably, The Weekly Dig, wherein I was mistaken for a man. Said 
		review set a precedent for this particular error, and taught me to 
		clarify my gender in any and all documents that accompany my work.
	</p>

	<p class="style4">
		Now for the substance: I'm the first to admit that I really don't 
		understand the relationship between my gender and the erotic within 
		the popular media. Why does the popular media stunt the erotic 
		range of women, churning out overly simplified representations of 
		female sexuality aimed at male and female consumers alike? Why can 
		women appear only as vessels for our cultural fantasies - whether 
		unnaturally pure or intensely impure? These remarkably 
		one-dimensional representations of my own sexual identity make me 
		want to guffaw and scream in almost equal measure. In retaliation, 
		my work takes this marketing of female sexual identity to what I 
		perceive as its logical extremes. These are my interpretations - 
		both sinister and humorous - of the eroticized chimeras to which 
		some look for inspiration, and others look for titillation.
